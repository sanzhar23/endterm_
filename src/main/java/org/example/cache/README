In this project, I implemented an additional bonus feature an in memory cache system for quizzes
I created a QuizCache class that stores quiz data in memory,uses the Singleton design pattern,prevents repeated database calls,clears automatically after create/delete operations
When the client calls GET /api/quizzes
The system:
First checks if quizzes are already stored in QuizCache
If data exists → it returns quizzes from cache
If not → it loads quizzes from the database
Then it saves them into cache
Next requests will use cached data

When a quiz is:Created or Deleted
The cache is cleared to keep data consistent
Singleton Pattern Usage: QuizCache class implements Singleton 
This ensures:
Only one cache object exists
All services share the same cache
Memory usage is controlled

improves:
Application performance
Response speed
Scalability
Reduces database calls
